# What is PRIMoRDiA?

PRIMoRDiA ( PRIMoRDiA Macromolecular Reactivity
Descriptors Access ) is a shared memory parallel software
written in C++ for post electronic structure calculations, that
efficiently reads output files from most used quantum mechanics packages, storing molecular information and processing
it to generate several descriptors to calculate the global and
local reactivity of molecular systems. PRIMoRDiA supports
the main reactivity descriptors of the Conceptual Density
Functional Theory, the most famous and used reactivity theory, which works from response variables of the electronic
structure of the molecules, as also other electrostatics properties.

Installation instructions and tutorials are in our [wiki](https://github.com/igorChem/PRIMoRDiA1.0v/wiki)
All theoretical background and working instructions of our program are in our userguide pdf file that can be found in this repository.

# Dowload and Installation



# Tutorials and Userguide

The following links present four basic tutorials on PRIMoRDiA usage. Running PRIMoRDiA is a very simple task, although the visualization of the results in graphical packages can become a complex task as the volume of results produced by PRIMoRDiA increases. Thus, the tutorials are an invitation to users to discuss the meaning of these theoretical quantities and understand how to transform them into useful chemical information.

1. [Tutorial 1](https://github.com/igorChem/PRIMoRDiA1.0v/wiki/Tutorial-1:-Calculating-Frozen-Orbital-Reactivity-Descriptors): Frozen Orbital Method calculations
2. [Tutorial 2](https://github.com/igorChem/PRIMoRDiA1.0v/wiki/Tutorial-2:-Calculating-Finite-Differences-Reactivity-Descripors): Finite Differences Method calculations
3. [Tutorial 3](https://github.com/igorChem/PRIMoRDiA1.0v/wiki/Tutorial-3:-Calculating-Reactivity-Descriptors-for-Macromolecules): Band Reactivity Descriptors
4. [Tutorial 4](https://github.com/igorChem/PRIMoRDiA1.0v/wiki/Tutorial-4:-Electron-Density-and-Molecular-Orbitals-Generation): Electron Density and Molecular Orbital generation

A complete description of the descriptors and their theory can be found in our [userguide](https://github.com/igorChem/PRIMoRDiA1.0v/blob/master/userguide/userguide.pdf) pdf file.
